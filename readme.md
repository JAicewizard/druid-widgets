This is a sample implementation of a dropdown for druid.
This is very much NOT complete, it is not even generic.

TODO:

- button right next to the text with an arrow.
- borders around the text
- detect out of window painting and draw up if needed
- allow max height, use scroll if this is used
- like, styling in general
